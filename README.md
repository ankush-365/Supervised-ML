# ðŸ§  Supervised Machine Learning

This repository contains my hands-on implementations of various **Supervised Machine Learning algorithms**. Each folder includes practical notebooks where I explore the intuition, implementation, evaluation, and usage of the algorithm in real-world scenarios.

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation & Understanding (Quick Guide)

- **Regression Models** â†’ Use when output is numerical  
- **Classification Models** â†’ Use when output is categorical  
- **Boosting Models** â†’ Use when you need higher accuracy and can afford longer training  
- **SVM / KNN** â†’ Works well on smaller and medium datasets  
- **Random Forest** â†’ Great all-rounder baseline model  
- **Regularization (Ridge/Lasso/Elastic)** â†’ Use when your model is overfitting
